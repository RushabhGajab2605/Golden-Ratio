# Golden Ratio Face Analyzer
A Python + OpenCV project that analyzes a human face and calculates how closely its proportions match the Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618).
The script detects facial landmarks (face, eyes, mouth region) using OpenCV Haar Cascades, computes multiple facial ratios, and generates an overall “Golden Closeness Score” along with annotated visual output.
